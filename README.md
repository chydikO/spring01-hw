# DAO Pattern for Blog Post Management

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for managing a list of blog posts. The DAO pattern provides an abstraction layer between the application and the underlying data source, allowing for separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

## Pattern Overview

The DAO pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic of an application. It provides a set of interfaces and classes that define the operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a data source.

For more information about the DAO pattern, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Oracle - Data Access Object](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/dataaccessobject.html)

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `Post` class: Represents an individual blog post with properties such as `id`, `title`, and `content`.
- `GenericDao` interface: Defines the generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for any data model.
- `PostDao` interface: Extends the `GenericDao` interface and specifies the operations specific to the `Post` model.
- `PostDaoSqlImpl` class: Implements the `PostDao` interface and provides the implementation for CRUD operations using MySQL as the data source.
- `PostService` class: Implements the business logic for working with blog posts. It injects an instance of `PostDaoMySqlImpl` using Spring dependency injection.
- Console Application: Demonstrates the usage of the `PostService` class in a console-based application.

## Usage

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Configure the MySQL database connection details in the `applicationContext.xml` file.
4. Build the project to resolve dependencies and compile the code.
5. Run the console application to see the demonstration of the `PostService` functionality.
